## Home Page

### Business Rules

#### Version 1.0


##### 1.  Introduction

The home page is the company's face to the world and it gest more page views than any other page. Users don't always enter a website from the homepage. A website is like a house in which every window is also a door: People can follow links from search engines and other websites that reach deep inside your site. However, one of the first things these users do after arriving at a new site is go to the homepage.

##### 2.  Research

According to the NNgroup, these are some things we can do to increase the home page's usability:

1- Include a one-sentence tagline
2 - Show the company name and/or logo in a reasonable size and noticeable location
3 - Emphasize the site's top high-priority tasks
4 - Include a search input box
5 - Emphasize the highest priority tasks so that users have a clear starting point on the homepage
6- Design the homepage to be clearly different from all the other pages on the site.
7- Inlude social proof (customer's reviews)
