All auth users can add a new memory at any time from the Navbar, by clicking on the "add new memory" button.

This action will launch the "add memory" wizard, from where the user will provide the initial minimum details to create a new memory.

In order to start a memory, the minimum required details are:

-   Memory cover Picture
-   Place (stop)
-   Arrival date
-   Memory title
-   Memory description
-   Privacy setting

Once this information is provided by the user, a memory is created and the user can edit all further details:

- Add new Stop
  - Select place
  - Add arrival date
  - Add pictures
-   Remove Stop
-   Edit stops
-   Edit initial general details
-   Delete Memory

### "Add new stop" quick access

When the user is currently on a live memory (based on the date), both on the feed and on the "My Memories" page, the first thing to show will be the current memory with an "Add Stop" CTA that will take the user directly to the add new stop screen

### Remove Stops and delete memory

If the user removes the initial stop while the memory still only has one stop, the memory will be deleted.

The user is able to delete the memory during the memory editing process before saving it regardless of the number of stops or information provided.

### Arrival date

The arrival date is set for each stop.

The user is allowed to set the same arrival date for different stops, in case they visited two different spots on the same day.

### Interaction and flows

The flow to add a new memory and further add more details to it until it is saved are described in the below diagrams
