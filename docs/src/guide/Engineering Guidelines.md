# Engineering philosophy

Summarize our team's approach to engineering here.

## History

Notes about how the current codebase evolved.

## Major principles

### DRY principle

> Don't repeat yourself

Main purposes:

- Reducing repetition of software patterns.
- Replacing it with abstractions.
- Using data normalization to avoid redundancy.

> Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.

### KISS principle

> Keep it simple, stupid

Key points:

- Simplicity should be a key goal in design.
- Unnecessary complexity should be avoided.

> Most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated.

### Reusability

> Use existing assets in some form within the software product development process, including code, software components, test suites, designs and documentation.

Main purposes:
  
- Increase reliability: components already tested
- Reduce process risk: less uncertainty in development costs
- Effective use of specialists: reuse of components instead of people
- Standards compliance
- Accelerated development

### Pair programming

> An agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation.

Key roles:

- The driver/pilot: writes code
- The navigator/observer: reviews each line of code as it is typed in and plans the action

Main purposes:

- Knowledge sharing
- Better code
- Less procrastination
- Faster onboarding
- Better team culture

> Increase code development time but reduce code defects.

### Algorithm analysis

#### Space complexity

#### Time complexity (Algo)

# Patterns to follow

- We can create `inline code snippets` with the shortcut `cmd/ctrl + e`.

# Code samples

Add code blocks for common snippets. Type `/code` and press `enter`. Choose the language you're using from the dropdown at the bottom right corner. Hover to copy with one click.

```jsx
var a = 1;
while (a <= 10) {
  document.write(a + "<br />");
  a++;
}
```
