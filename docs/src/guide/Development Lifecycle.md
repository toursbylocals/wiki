# Overview

Development lifecycle is a defined processes for a developer team within ToursByLocals to be used to design, develope and test a high quality codeing. These following phases of development will impove the quality of projects.

## Onboarding Initiative

- install and configure softwares up to date
- learn how MTJ and TBL works
  - database
  - code
  - live website
  - documentation
- go though Wiki step by step

## Initiative Analysis / Evaluation

- getter all infromation from all department stackeholders such as, operation, marketing, accounting, etc.

- epics are helpful way to organize projects and easy to break work down into shippable pieces per each sprints

## Grooming

- create/update stories based on feedbacks and requirements
- collaborate with development team members and product owners
- discuss the technical feasibility and risks
- ensure that everyone understands the purpose of the stories and how it should be implemented

## Planning

- analyze each stories and estimate the points

## Coding

- make sure to follow the desciption as written in a task and start to develope

## Testing

- test the product that is built
- report product defects, track, fix and retest until the product reachs to the quality as describe in a task

## Reviewing

- demonstrate it to the development team members and product owners
- discusss if there was any blocks

## QA'ing

- make sure the product is at the highest quality and other related products are working correctly

## Release
